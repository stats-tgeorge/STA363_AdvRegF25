You are not going to answer their questions but use the questions data to answer your own questions.\n    -   I do ask that different groups choose different datasets. Choose a few options.\n\n**Data Options: Check out Data Links on the [Useful Links](../course-links.qmd) part of the course website. *TidyTuesday* has quickly accessible data.**\n\n-   Write out the anticipated cleaning and/or feature engineering steps you will need to take. Some examples:\n    -   Creating simplified categorical variables or transforming a continuous variable into categorical.\n    -   Aggregating data\n    -   Converting date columns\n    -   etc.\n\n-   Setup your R Project(s) on the server.\n\n-   Read your data into R. This likely will require you to download the data to your computer and upload the data the server.\n\n# Project Day\n\n## Timing\n\nThis project will be in a *workshop* style. The intention is for you to start and finish by the end of class time. We will follow a timeline:\n\n| Task                                       | Timing                                 |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Clean Data                                 | 9:00 am - 9:30 am                      |\n| Perform EDA                                | 9:30 am - 10:30 am                     |\n| Fit, Assess, and Compare Regression Models | 10:30 am - 11:00 am, 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm |\n| Prepare presentation                       | 2:00 pm - 2:20 pm                      |\n| Present your findings                      | 2:20 pm - 2:40 pm                      |\n| Submit your Final Report                   | Submit HTML Sunday 9/8 at 11:59 pm     |\n\n### Grading\n\nEach Mini Project is worth 50 points (Labs are 10 points each).\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Points |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| R project was created the day before, data read into the environment, and cleaning steps were written.                                                                                                                                       | 2       |\n| The data chosen is appropriate, and the cleaning steps are correct and explained.                                                                                                                                                            |  3      |\n| EDA is thorough. All graphs and tables included are paired with a discussion. EDA supports the choice of modeling technique.                                                                                                                 | 15     |\n| The model fitting process has a logical flow. Multiple models are considered and compared using statistical tests and various metrics. Any interpreted model has been assessed using residual plots and appropriate statistical tests.       | 15     |\n| The code follows a sensible order and has been appropriately commented on.                                                                                                                                                                   | 5      |\n| The presentation is concise, describes the data, highlights key parts of the EDA, describes minimally the final model, gives at least 1 interpretation in the context of a coefficient, and discusses limitations and potential future work. | 5      |\n| The report is well written, with correct spelling and grammar. The used code is included either inline or in an appendix at the end.                                                                                                         | 5      |\n\n### Submission\n\nAdd format part of your final report document and then re-render:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n---\ntitle: \"Document title\"\nauthor: \"my name\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n---\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document.
