The embed-resources component will make your final rendered `html` self-contained.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n---\ntitle: \"Document title\"\nauthor: \"my name\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n---\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nBe sure to include the relevant R code as well as full sentences answering each of the questions (i.e. if I ask for the average, you can output the answer in R but **also** write a full sentence with the answer). Be sure to frequently save your files!\n\nIn this homework we will work with four packages: `tidyverse` which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way, `tidymodels` for statistical model coefficients, `splines` for our splines models and `ISLR2` for the `Boston` data. \n\n\n## Code\n\n#### Polynomial Regression\n\nTo fit a degree 4 polynomial regression model you use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel1 <- lm(wage ~ poly(age , 4, raw = TRUE), data = wage)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Cubic Spline\n\nTo fit a cubic spline (degree 3) polynomial regression model you use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel2<- lm(wage ~ bs(age , knots = c(22, 33, 50), degree = 3), data = Wage)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse quantiles of the predictor to choose your knots. The choice should be motivated by some EDA. \n\n\n#### Natual Cubic Spline\n\nTo fit a degree natural cubic spline. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel3 <- lm(wage ~ ns(age,df = 4), data = Wage)\n```\n:::\n\n\nInstead of providing the degrees of freedom (df), you can provide knots. \n\n\n## Exercises\n\nAll problems are from {{< var course.text2 >}} Abbreviated ISLR. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ISLR2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n1. Suppose we fit a curve with basis functions $b_1(X) = X,\\space b_2(X) = (X − 1)^2I(X \\geq 1)$. (Note that $I(X \\geq 1)$ equals 1 for $X \\geq 1$ and 0 otherwise.) We fit the linear regression model \n\n$$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1b_1(X) + \\beta_2b_2(X) + \\epsilon,$$ <br>\n\nand obtain coefficient estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = 1,\\space \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 1,\\space \\hat{\\beta}_2 = −2$. Sketch the estimated curve between $X = −2$ and $X = 2$. Note the intercepts, slopes, and other relevant information.\n\n2. (ISLR,7,9) This question uses the variables `dis` (the weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers) and `nox` (nitrogen oxides concentration in parts per 10 million) from the Boston data (in package `ISLR2`). We will treat `dis` as the predictor and `nox` as the response.\n\n  (a) Use the `poly()` function to fit a cubic polynomial regression to predict `nox` using `dis`. Report the regression output, and plot the resulting data and polynomial fits.\n  \n  (b) Plot the polynomial fits for a range of different polynomial degrees (say, from 1 to 5), and report the associated residual sum of squares.\n  \n  (c) Select the optimal degree for the polynomial, and explain your results.\n  \n  (d) Use the `bs()` function to fit a regression spline to predict `nox` using `dis`. Report the output for the fit using four degrees of freedom. How did you choose the knots? Plot the resulting fit.\n  \n  (e) Now fit a regression spline for a range of degrees of freedom, and plot the resulting fits and report the resulting RSS. Describe the results obtained.\n\n  (e) Now fit a natural regression spline for a range of degrees of freedom, and plot the resulting fits and report the resulting RSS. Describe the results obtained.\n  \n  (f) Pick an overall best model using various metrics, complexity, and regression assumptions to make your choice. They are the same metrics used in multiple linear regression. \n\n# Submission\n\nWhen you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document. Once rendered, you can download your file by:\n\n-   Finding the .html file in your File pane (on the bottom right of the screen)\n-   Click the check box next to the file\n-   Click the blue gear above and then click \"Export\" to download\n-   Submit your final html document to the respective assignment on [Moodle]({{< var course.moodle >}})\n\n\n\n",
