The embed-resources component will make your final rendered `html` self-contained.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ---\n    title: \"Document title\"\n    author: \"my name\"\n    format:\n      html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    ---\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nBe sure to include the relevant R code as well as full sentences answering each of the questions (i.e. if I ask for the average, you can output the answer in R but **also** write a full sentence with the answer). Be sure to frequently save your files!\n\nData for the homework will be in the STA363_inst_files -> data folder.\n\n## Exercises\n\nAll problems are from {{< var course.text >}}. Abbreviated BMLR. \n\nUse the numbering on the left. The codes are for instructor use (Ex: C1).\n\n### Exercise 1\n\n1. (C1) At what value of $p$ is the standard deviation of a binary random variable smallest? When is standard deviation largest?\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n2. (C3) How are exponential and Poisson random variables related?\n\n\n### Exercise 3\n\n3. (C7) Chapter 1 also asked you to consider a scenario where *\"Researchers are attempting to see if socioeconomic status and parental stability are predictive of low birthweight.  They classify a low birthweight as below 2500 g, hence our response is binary: 1 for low birthweight, and 0 when the birthweight is not low.\"* What distribution might be useful to model if a newborn has low birthweight?\n\n### Exercise 4\n\n4. (C9) Describe a scenario which could be modeled using a gamma distribution.\n\n### Exercise 5\n\n5. (G2) __Gamma-Poisson mixture I.__ Use the R function `rpois()` to generate 10,000 $x_i$ from a plain old vanilla Poisson random variable, $X \\sim \\textrm{Poisson}(\\lambda=1.5)$. Plot a histogram of this distribution and note its mean and standard deviation. Next, let  $Y \\sim \\textrm{Gamma}(r = 3, \\lambda = 2)$ and use `rgamma()` to generate 10,000 random $y_i$ from this distribution. Now, consider 10,000 different Poisson distributions where $\\lambda_i = y_i$. Randomly generate one $z_i$ from each Poisson distribution. Plot a histogram of these $z_i$ and compare it to your original histogram of $X$ (where $X \\sim \\textrm{Poisson}(1.5)$). How do the means and standard deviations compare?\n\n# Submission\n\nWhen you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document. Once rendered, you can download your file by:\n\n-   Finding the .html file in your File pane (on the bottom right of the screen)\n-   Click the check box next to the file\n-   Click the blue gear above and then click \"Export\" to download\n-   Submit your final html document to the respective assignment on [Moodle]({{< var course.moodle >}})\n\n\n\n",
