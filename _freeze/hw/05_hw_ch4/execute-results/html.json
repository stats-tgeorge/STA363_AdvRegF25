The embed-resources component will make your final rendered `html` self-contained.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ---\n    title: \"Document title\"\n    author: \"my name\"\n    format:\n      html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    ---\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nBe sure to include the relevant R code as well as full sentences answering each of the questions (i.e. if I ask for the average, you can output the answer in R but **also** write a full sentence with the answer). Be sure to frequently save your files!\n\nData for the homework will be in the STA363_inst_files -> data folder.\n\n## Exercises\n\nAll problems are from {{< var course.text >}} Abbreviated BMLR. \n\nUse the numbering on the left. The codes are for instructor use (Ex: C1).\n\n## Excercise 1\n\n1. (C15) __Dating online.__ Researchers are interested in the number of dates respondents arranged online and whether the rates differ by age group. Questions which elicit responses similar to this can be found in the Pew Survey concerning dating online and relationships [@Duggan2013]. Each survey respondent was asked how many dates they have arranged online in the past 3 months as well as the typical amount of time, $t$, in hours, they spend online weekly. Some rows of data appear in Table 1.\n\t\n    - Identify the response, predictor, and offset in this context.  Does using an offset make sense?\n    - Write out a model for this data. As part of your model description, define the parameter, $\\lambda$.\n    - Consider a zero-inflated Poisson model for this data. Describe what the `true zeros' would be in this setting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Table 1: Sample data for Exercise 1.</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Age </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Time Online </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Number of Dates Arranged Online </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 35 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 29 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 38 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 55 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n2. (C16) __Poisson approximation: rare events.__ For rare diseases, the probability of a case occurring, $p$, in a very large population, $n$, is small. With a small $p$ and large $n$, the random variable $Y$= the number of cases out of $n$ people can be approximated using a Poisson random variable with $\\lambda = np$. If the count of those with the disease is observed in several different populations independently of one another, the $Y_i$ represents the number of cases in the $i^{th}$ population and can be approximated using a Poisson random variable with $\\lambda_i=n_ip_i$ where $p_i$ is the probability of a case for the $i^{th}$ population. Poisson regression can take into account the differences in the population sizes, $n_i$, using as an offset log($n_i$) as well as differences in a population characteristic like $x_i$. The coefficient of the offset is set at one; it is not estimated like the other coefficients.  Thus the model statement has the form: $log(\\lambda_i) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i + log(n_i)$, where $Y_i  \\sim$ Poisson($\\lambda_i = n_i p_i$). Note that $\\lambda_i$ depends on $x_i$ which may differ for the different populations.\n\n    @Scotto1974 wondered if skin cancer rates by age group differ by city.  Based on their data in Table 2, identify and describe the following quantities which appear in the description of the Poisson approximation for rare events:\n\n      - A case,\n      - The population size, $n_i$,\n      - Probability, $p_i$,\n      - Poisson parameter, $\\lambda_i$,\n      - Poisson random variables, $Y_i$, and\n      - The predictors, $X_i$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Table 2: Data from Scotto et al.

(G6) __U.S. National Medical Expenditure Survey.__ The data set `NMES1988` in the `AER` package contains a sample of individuals over 65 who are covered by Medicare in order to assess the demand for health care through physician office visits, outpatient visits, ER visits, hospital stays, etc.  The data can be accessed by installing and loading the `AER` package and then running `data(NMES1988)`.  More background information and references about the `NMES1988` data can be found in help pages for the `AER` package.  \n\n    a. Show through graphical means that there are more respondents with 0 `visits` than might be expected under a Poisson model.\n    b. Fit a ZIP model for the number of physician office `visits` using `chronic`, `health`, and `insurance` as predictors for the Poisson count, and `chronic` and `insurance` as the predictors for the binary part of the model.  Then, provide interpretations in context for the following model parameters:\n\n    - `chronic` in the Poisson part of the model\n    - poor `health` in the Poisson part of the model\n    - the Intercept in the logistic part of the model\n    - `insurance` in the logistic part of the model\n \n    c. Is there significant evidence that the ZIP model is an improvement over a simple Poisson regression model? \n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n4. (C1) For each distribution below,\n\n    - Write the pmf or pdf in one-parameter exponential form, if possible.\n    - Describe an example of a setting where this random variable might be used.\n    - Identify the canonical link function, and\n    - Compute $\\mu = -\\frac{c'(\\theta)}{b'(\\theta)}$ and $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{b''(\\theta)c'(\\theta)-c''(\\theta)b'(\\theta)}{[b'(\\theta)]^3}$ and compare with known $\\E(Y)$ and $\\var(Y)$.\n    \n    \na) Binomial (for fixed $n$): Y = number of successes in $n$ independent, identical trials\n\n  $$P(Y=y;p)=\\left(\\begin{array} {c}  n\\\\y  \\end{array}\\right) p^y(1-p)^{(n-y)}$$\n  \n\nb) Gamma (for fixed $r$): Y = time spent waiting for the $r^{th}$ event in a Poisson process with an average rate of $\\lambda$ events per unit of time\n\n  $$f(y; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^r}{\\Gamma(r)} y^{r-1} e^{-\\lambda y}$$\n  \n# Submission\n\nWhen you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document.
