## Questions


1.  Is there initial evidence of more bites during full moon phases?

2.  Why can’t we just perform a t-test comparing full moon periods to non-full moon periods using period-level data (n=10)?

3.  What options can you think of for handling the fact that Period 5 is based on only 2 lunar days? What are the modeling implications of including number of days in a period as an offset term?

4.  Interpret model parameters from **fit1**.

5.  Is there any evidence of lack of fit in **fit1**? What factors may lead to lack of fit?

6.  Does full moon have an effect above and beyond the linear cycle trend? Interpret the coefficient and a 95% confidence interval for the *fullmoon* term in **fit3**.

7.  What is **fit4** doing? Does it offer an improvement over **fit3**?

8.  What evidence is there that **fit5** (which uses *bitesbyday.csv*) is the analysis performed by the authors of this paper?

9.  Based on this analysis, does it make you more wary of animal bites during full moons?

### Addressing issues of overdispersion in fit5.

10. Is there evidence of lack of fit in **fit5**? Cite evidence both from a goodness of fit test and from comparing means and variances by period.

11. If overdispersion goes uncorrected, what are implications for p-values and CIs for model coefficients?

#### Overdispersion parameter adjustment. 
One solution is to simply add a second parameter to inflate variances, so that $Var(Y_i)=\phi\lambda_i$. This is called a “quasi-Poisson” or, in general, a “quasi-likelihood” approach, because our data no longer follows a true Poisson distribution.

#### Negative binomial modeling. 
Another solution is to model response using a negative binomial distribution, so that $Y\sim NegBinom(\theta,p)$. This distribution comes about if $Y|λ\sim Poisson(λ)$, but the $\lambda$'s themselves are randomly chosen according to a gamma distribution: $\lambda \sim gamma(θ,\frac{(1-p)}{p})$. In this case, $E(Y)=\theta \frac{p}{(1-p)}=\mu $ and $Var(Y)=\theta \frac{p}{(1-p)^2} =\mu+\frac{\mu^2}{\theta}$, so that $\frac{\mu^2}{\theta}$ is the amount of overdispersion.

12. Compare the following estimates, tests, and intervals under usual Poisson regression, quasi-Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression:
