## Lab Setup

1) Copy the project lab folder located at *Home -> STA363_inst_files-> labs*. If you check the box next to the folder name, then click the small gear icon you can "copy to" and put a copy of the folder in your newly created folder. 
2) Now, click *File-> Open Project* and navigate to the project file in the folder you just copied. 
3) You can place your responses in the file *qmd* file included. 

## Introduction

Does having boys or girls run in the family?  Using demographic data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, can we identify biases in sex composition patterns of children?  The data is found in Table 2 in the Rodgers and Doughty (2001) article, and relevant R code can be found under below.  


## Questions

#### Model 1 – Sex Unconditional Model.  Each child is independent of the others, and there is a constant probability ( ) that a child is a boy.

1. Consider a small example with 3 families with compositions of children given by BBG, GBG, and GG.  
Find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for   by:
a)	Conducting a numerical search in R for the largest likelihood over a fine grid of values 0-1.

b)	Conducting a numerical search in R for the largest log-likelihood between 0 and 1.
Illustrate the process graphically, and report the maximum value of the likelihood and log-likelihood functions.  Does it make sense that both methods would agree (and agree with the mathematical approach)?


2. Apply Model 1 to the NLSY data (families in Table 2.4 below who have 3 or fewer children).  Find the MLE for   by adapting the R code for (1). There are 5,626 families in the table. 


```{r, include=FALSE}
Famcomp <- c("B","G","BB","BG","GB","GG","BBB","BBG",
             "BGG","BGB","GBB","GGB","GBG","GGG")
Numfams <- c(930,951,582,666,666,530,186,177,173,
             148,151,125,182,159)
Numchild <- c(930,951,1164,1332,1332,1060,558,531,
              519,444,453,375,546,477)
```
    
```{r, table4chp2}
#Family comp data table
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

table5chp2 <- data.frame(Famcomp, Numfams, Numchild)

table5chp2 |> kbl(col.names = c("Family Composition",
    "Number of families", "Number of children"),
      caption = "Table 2.4 Number of families and children in families with given composition in NLSY data.") 
```


#### Model 2 – Sex Conditional Model.  The probability of having a boy depends on whether you’ve had boys previously, so Model 2 will have three parameters:

 = probability of a boy when previously have had an equal number of boys and girls (neutral)
 
 = probability of a boy when previously have had more boys than girls (boy bias)
 
 = probability of a boy when previously have had more girls than boys (girl bias)

3. Write out the likelihood function given Model 2 for the small set of data in (1).  [You could also try BGG, GGB, BBB just for fun.]

#### Model 1: Sex Unconditional Model

Assumes the sex for each birth is independent of other births

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Evaluate small set of possible values of pb
pb <- c(.3, .35, .375, .4, .45)  # possible values for prob a boy is born
lik <- pb^3 * (1 - pb)^5         # likelihood of getting observed data

lik <- pb^3 * (1 - pb)^5         # likelihood of getting observed data
plot(pb, lik, xlab = "possible values of pb", ylab = "Likelihood", type = "l")
max(lik)                         # maximum likelihood over 1001 values of pb
pb[lik == max(lik)]              # value of pb where likelihood maximized

loglik <- 3 * log(pb) + 5 * log(1 - pb)      # find log likelihoods
plot(pb, loglik, xlab = "possible values of pb", ylab = "Loglikelihood", 
     type = "l")
max(loglik)                    # maximum loglikelihood over 1001 values of pb
pb[loglik == max(loglik)]      # likelihood and loglikelihood max at same spot
mle_pb_m1_small <- pb[loglik == max(loglik)]
max_logL_m1_small <- max(loglik)

ggplot(data = model1grid, aes(x = pb, y = loglik1)) +

```

#### Model 2: Sex Conditional Model (small 3 famly data set)

Assumes probability of having a boy depends on whether you've had boys previously

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Find MLEs with 3-dimensional grid search
pbb <- seq(0, 1, length = 101)
pbg <- seq(0, 1, length = 101)
pbn <- seq(0, 1, length = 101)
model2_grid <- expand.grid(pbb = pbb, pbg = pbg, pbn = pbn)

lik <- model2_grid$pbn^1 * (1 - model2_grid$pbn)^3 * model2_grid$pbb^1 * 
  (1 - model2_grid$pbb)^1 * model2_grid$pbg^1 * (1 - model2_grid$pbg)^1
loglik <- 1 * log(model2_grid$pbn) + 3 * log(1 - model2_grid$pbn) + 
  1 * log(model2_grid$pbb) + 1 * log(1 - model2_grid$pbb) + 
  1 * log(model2_grid$pbg) + 1 * log(1 - model2_grid$pbg)

# Print results
max(lik)        # maximum likelihood over all combos of pbb, pbg, pbn
max(loglik)     # maximum loglikelihood over all combos of pbb, pbg, pbn

model2_grid$pbb[loglik == max(loglik)]   # MLE of pbb
model2_grid$pbg[loglik == max(loglik)]   # MLE of pbg
model2_grid$pbn[loglik == max(loglik)]   # MLE of pbn

# Store results
mle_pbb_m2_small <- model2_grid$pbb[loglik == max(loglik)]   # MLE of pbb
mle_pbg_m2_small <- model2_grid$pbg[loglik == max(loglik)]   # MLE of pbg
mle_pbn_m2_small <- model2_grid$pbn[loglik == max(loglik)]   # MLE of pbn

max_L_m2_small <- max(lik)
max_logL_m2_small <- max(loglik)
```

### Model comparisons - Model 1 vs. Model 2

```{r eval=FALSE}
lrt <- 2 * (max_logL_m2_small - max_logL_m1_small)   
lrt                       # likelihood ratio test statistic
1 - pchisq(lrt, df = 2)   # p-value for testing Ho: no diff between Models 1&2

# AIC and BIC values for Models 1 and 2
aic1 <- -2 * max_logL_m1_small + 2 * 1
aic1
bic1 <- -2 * max_logL_m1_small + log(8) * 1
bic1
aic2 <- -2 * max_logL_m2_small + 2 * 3
aic2
bic2 <- -2 * max_logL_m2_small + log(8) * 3
bic2
```
