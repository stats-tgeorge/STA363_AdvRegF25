## Setup

Each of your assignments will begin with the following steps.

-   Going to our RStudio Server at <http://turing.cornellcollege.edu:8787/>

-   Creating a new *R project*, inside your homework folder on the server, and giving it a sensible name such as *homework_3* and having that project in the course folder you created. 

-   Create a new quarto document and give it a sensible name such as *hw3*.

-   In the `YAML` add the following (add what you don't have). The embed-resources component will make your final rendered `html` self-contained.

    ```{r}
#| label: yaml_example
#| eval: false
---
title: "Document title"
author: "my name"
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
---
    ```

## Instructions

Be sure to include the relevant R code as well as full sentences answering each of the questions (i.e. if I ask for the average, you can output the answer in R but **also** write a full sentence with the answer). Be sure to frequently save your files!

Data for the homework will be in the STA363_inst_files -> data folder.

## Exercises

All problems are from {{< var course.text >}}. Abbreviated BMLR. 

Use the numbering on the left. The codes are for instructor use (Ex: C1).

### Exercise 1

1. (C1) At what value of $p$ is the standard deviation of a binary random variable smallest? When is standard deviation largest?

### Exercise 2

2. (C3) How are exponential and Poisson random variables related?


### Exercise 3

3. (C7) Chapter 1 also asked you to consider a scenario where *"Researchers are attempting to see if socioeconomic status and parental stability are predictive of low birthweight.  They classify a low birthweight as below 2500 g, hence our response is binary: 1 for low birthweight, and 0 when the birthweight is not low."* What distribution might be useful to model if a newborn has low birthweight?

### Exercise 4

4. (C9) Describe a scenario which could be modeled using a gamma distribution.

### Exercise 5

5. (G2) __Gamma-Poisson mixture I.__ Use the R function `rpois()` to generate 10,000 $x_i$ from a plain old vanilla Poisson random variable, $X \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda=1.5)$. Plot a histogram of this distribution and note its mean and standard deviation. Next, let  $Y \sim \textrm{Gamma}(r = 3, \lambda = 2)$ and use `rgamma()` to generate 10,000 random $y_i$ from this distribution. Now, consider 10,000 different Poisson distributions where $\lambda_i = y_i$. Randomly generate one $z_i$ from each Poisson distribution. Plot a histogram of these $z_i$ and compare it to your original histogram of $X$ (where $X \sim \textrm{Poisson}(1.5)$). How do the means and standard deviations compare?

# Submission

When you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document. Once rendered, you can download your file by:

-   Finding the .html file in your File pane (on the bottom right of the screen)
-   Click the check box next to the file
-   Click the blue gear above and then click "Export" to download
-   Submit your final html document to the respective assignment on [Moodle]({{< var course.moodle >}})
